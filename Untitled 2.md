### DIED AT 75; LEAVES MOTHER 97
[[Mary Olney]] Scott, widow of the
late T. J. Scott, an old-time resident
of Marion county, in the lola neigh-
borhood, near Durham, died at her
home in Moravia, Appanoose county,
Iowa, October 17, 1917, aged 74 years,
and 9 months. Those who may say
that this woman "lived to a ripe old
age," will be surprised to learn that
her mother is still living at the age
of 97 and Is a resident of Knoxville.
The mother is Mrs. [[Eliza A. Olney]],
who makes her home with her son,
[[Jasper Olney]], on East Marion street.
The son referred to is 67 years old.

Mrs. Scott will be remembered by
a number of the old pioneers of Clay
and Lake Prairie townships. She
came to this county with her parents
in 1852 and with them removed to
Clay township. Mary Olney was a
favorite among the students of Cen-
tral University at Pella, where she
graduated in 1862. She became a
leading school teacher in this sec-
tion of the state and took up her
profession in Appanoose county. In
the fall of 1864 she was united in
marriage with T. J. Scott, a farmer
near Moravia. He died three years
ago. Many other interesting facts
could be told of the life of Mrs. Mary
Olney Scott, but the most remarkable
is that she lived nearly five
years past the Biblical age limit of
three score and ten and then left her
mother to mourn her death.

The funeral services took place at
the M. B. church in Moravia last
Thursday. Burial at Moravia.â€”
