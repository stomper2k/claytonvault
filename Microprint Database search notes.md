# Microprint Database Notes
- page jumps when selecting specific fields -- better to trigger the page update when the Search button is clicked
- what's the point of including the Item ID as a search field? 
- Search fields should automatically limit choices in subsequent fields -- for example, selecting Texas in the State field should limit the County field to just counties in Texas.
- County field could be relabeled County/Parish, since we do have a large percentage of patrons researching Louisiana.
- The presentation could be larger, with more contrast.
