### The Mindset
- The arrival of [[Google.com]] has meant the decline in demand for reference services. A surge in popularity of family history research provides a new opportunity for reference libraries to regain lost patrons. 
- Reference staff members need adequate training to offer the specialized assistance required for genealogy researchers.
#### Mantra: "It is exciting to watch history come alive for researchers"
>...the information professional as "the best of all finding aids."
- Family history is personal history and so is more important to the researcher than general history.
>Every life story is a part of the greater fabric of history.
#### Mantra: "I am going to enjoy the process of working with researchers, and not always look for the conclusion of the process."
- In genealogy research the process is what is important. The mindset is to be [[process oriented]], not end-product focused.
#### Mantra: "I come to learn as well as teach."
- Attempts to appear omniscient are destined to fail eventually.
- Work collegially, *with* the patron.
#### Mantra: "I do not have to be an expert genealogist in order to provide good genealogy service."
- Through practice and training, reference providers learn how to *find* knowledge. 








### The Patrons
- Most genealogists are hobbyists, but there is a broad range of experience, research ability, and goals amongst them.
- All of the approaches to research are valid and deserve support by information providers.
- Try to prepare researchers before they arrive:
	- Post on your website the kind of information that the patron should come prepared with, and where that location might be located. See Allen County Public Library ["The Research Process"](https://youtu.be/8g_IQ927kt4)
	- Link to a guide for research trip preparation. ["A Trip to Bountiful Genealogy Research"](http://www.archives.com/experts/macentee-thomas/a-trip-to-bountiful-genealogy-research.html)
	- A short video tour of your library and resources is helpful to researchers preparation ahead of their visit.
	- Distribute handouts with all this information in order to educate the patrons for their next visit.

### The Reference Interview
> Like paintings done in the pointillism style, family history research is comprised of hundreds of tiny, very specific facts
#### Where to Start: The Greeting
- Pay attention to non-verbal communication: approach patrons with an open attitude; a smiling, pleasant demeanor.
- Stand as the patron approaches
- An overly broad first question can burden the patron with being specific, when they often aren't able
- "Hello, what may I help you find today?" allows the patron to be more specific in their request.
- Probe for the actual information need
#### Establishing the Contexts
- It takes information to get information. Establish the following three contexts:
	- geographical: where the ancestor lived
	- chronological: when the ancestor lived
	- socioeconomic: the ancestor's status within their community
- The idea is to create a profile of known clues about the family, even if the clues have not been verified.
- [[The Newbie]]: no idea where to start
- [[The Gusher]]: knows a lot and is eager to share
- [[The Confused]]: asks for a source, but has no idea how to use it
- [[The Optimist]]: confident everything is in "the book"
- [[The Disorganized Patron]]: unable to ask focused question due to disorganized files 
- [[The Wounded]]: a highly emotional researcher
- [[The Monopolizer]]: asks a never-ending series of questions
- [[The Shootist]]: makes impossibly broad requests
#### Identify Specific Resources to Meet the Research Goal
- A wide variety of sources are available to local studies researchers, and identifying them all is a challenge to information providers
- Consider compiling or providing a locality guide -- a written overview of communities' sources
- [[Family History Library]] ([[FHL]]) in Salt Lake City has a toll-free number: 866-406-1830, and is available 24 hours a day.
- If a question cannot be answered with available resources, remember to consider [[negative search results]] and [[background information sources]]
- Indexing vs. records
	- Indexing is not a reliable source of genealogical information
	- Indexing is an aid to tracking down genealogical sources
	- An index usually doesn't contain every piece of information on a record
	- Indexes are not perfect
	- An index is another step removed from the original record
#### Attention to Detail
- remind patrons to record source information so they can find it again later, or someone else can examine the sources they used
- label photographs and supply citations for any information supplied to patrons
- obtain contact information for regular patrons
- integrate all library services into the research process
- direct patrons to the best staff member to help with their research needs
#### *Sensei:* The Role of Teaching
- Don't assume patrons possess basic library skills. It may be necessary to instruct them on how to use, record and interpret resources
- about half of the members of Florida genealogical societies polled had ever used the online catalog of their local library
#### The Last Step: Referrals
- it is often necessary to make referrals
- figure out where the needed information can be found
- Never just shrug and say, "Sorry, we can't help."
- Always end an interaction on a positive note
- **We our our institution to the patron.**
#### Success and Failures
- [Rookie Mistakes â€¢ FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/en/Rookie_Mistakes)
- Have a sense of [[what makes successful researchers successful]].
