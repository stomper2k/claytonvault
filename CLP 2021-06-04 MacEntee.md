I discovered some obituaries noted the partner as "sister" or "brother" and discovering they are not a sibling.

I'm thinking using the functionality in MyHeritage to identify who lives at the same address in city directories could be very useful for identifying LGBT relatives.

Thank you for explaining about "partner" in 1940 census.    In 1930 census, my great-aunt was listed as partner of the head of household; and there were two other women as well living in household, all of them listed as partners.  What do you think?

Thank you, Thomas!  I haven't found any LGBTQ family yet, but it's good to have the background for the "code"

Could there be such a friendly neighborhood or town even as far back as the 1860s-1880s? The city my ancestor lived in was Quincy, Illinois.  No one else in the family lived there.

What about people who went into the priesthood or nunnery?  Or other religious orders?
