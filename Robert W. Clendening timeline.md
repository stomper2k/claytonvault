Robert Clendening, sr., who died March 27th, 1891, was born October 15, 1810, in Tyrone county, Ireland. His life on earth completed a cycle of eighty years, five months and twelve days. At the age of fifteen years he came to America and located in the Dominion of Canada. In 1833 he removed to Miami County. His first real estate was [[pre-empted]] on what is now the Solomon See farm in Jefferson township, two miles west of the village of Denver. In 1849 he enlarged his possessions by purchasing a quarter section of land in Richland township, where he resided until his death. December 8th, 1839, he was united in marriage to Cynthia Clymer, who bore him nine children, five of whom survive their mother, who died March 14, 1863. The subject of this sketch was married to Mrs. Nancy Waite in 1864. To this marriage was born one daughter, now living. In 1866 he married Mrs. Nancy Lawrence, his widow.  
  
The deceased was a man who had seen Miami County in all its stages of prosperity rise from an almost unbroken wilderness, inhabited by a few sturdy pioneers, and the remnant of once powerful Indian tribes to take its place in the front rank of counties in Indiana. He has witnessed the disappearance of forests, the bridging of rivers, the building of canal and railroads, and the growth of Peru from an insignificant village to a prosperous city. His life's duration marks an epoch in the development of the great Northwest. He was a man hasty in action, violent in speech and at times imperious and exacting to those about him. In extenuation it may be said that no man ever discovered a taint of revenged nor a trace of malice in his make-up. He would go out of his way to meet anyone with whom he had had an altercation to offer the honest clasp of friendship. Nature gave him a forgiving spirit and a religious bent. In his latter days one might frequently find him in odd places engaged in a prayer of forgiveness for some rash expression. No mendicant ever stopped at this door and missed a welcome. The destitute and affluent alike knew him as "Uncle Robert." The old and the young, the learned and the ignorant found a companion in "Uncle Robert." He passed away without pain. The angel of death found him ready. To his spiritual advisor he spoke as follows: "I have a peace within that the world knows nothing of." The interment was at the Chili cemetery where a large concourse of friends bade a final adieu to all that was earthly of "Uncle Robert."
