Genealogy is a research field concerned primarily with accurately reconstructing forgotten or unknown identities and relationships. — location: [182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=182)

---
The Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS) — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=193)

---
Applicable to family history research across geopolitical boundaries, societies, languages, and time, the GPS helps us produce trustworthy family histories, enabling future generations to build upon our work. — location: [194](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=194)

---
Research establishes conclusions that advance knowledge. — location: [197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=197)

---
All kinds of genealogical sources contain misinformation. The errors may be accidents of hearing, interpreting, memory, reading, or writing. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=203)

---
Genealogists call acceptable conclusions “proved.” — location: [208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=208)

---
Researchers in many nongenealogical fields use large data sets. Random errors in such data tend to negate each other, and an error in one observation will not affect the overall pattern or trend under study. Genealogists, however, focus on one person and relationship at a time, often with limited data. One error can alter a research outcome. — location: [223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=223)One wrong turn can send you down the wrong road.

---
A universal standard also gives us a shared framework for understanding genealogical methods and reasoning. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=229)

---
The standard has five components: Thorough (“reasonably exhaustive”) searches in sources that might help answer a research question — location: [233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=233)

---
Informative (“complete, accurate”) citations to the sources of every information item contributing to the research question’s answer Analysis and comparison (“correlation”) of the relevant sources and information to assess their usefulness as evidence of the research question’s answer Resolution of any conflicts between evidence and the proposed answer to a research question A written statement, list, or narrative supporting the answer — location: [236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=236)

---
The GPS’s five elements can make our genealogical work both trustworthy and longstanding: Thorough research reduces the probability that newfound evidence will overturn a proved conclusion. If new evidence arises, it more likely will support or augment that conclusion than to call it into question. Citations describe sources supporting the conclusion and show those sources’ qualities as — location: [244](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=244)

---
providers of evidence. By showing the basis on which a conclusion rests, citations enable research consumers to see how trustworthy it is. Analysis and correlation test genealogical evidence. Analysis shows that the conclusion rests on the most-likely accurate sources available. Correlation shows that the proof reflects what combined relevant evidence shows. Together, analysis and correlation show that a conclusion is unbiased. Resolution of conflicting evidence ensures that all relevant evidence, not just part of it, supports the conclusion. A written conclusion makes the proof transparent to others. It consequently lays a foundation for future researchers to extend a family’s history. — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=249)

What is genealogy? — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=297)Genealogy is a research field concerned primarily with accurately reconstructing

---
Research in any field is designed to answer focused questions. Genealogy is no different. Focused genealogical questions also frame our research scope, lead us to relevant information, and help us identify evidence. — location: [310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=310)

---
Too-broad questions allow several correct answers. — location: [318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=318)

---
Too-narrow questions may be unanswerable with records of a place and time. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=322)

---
Most major genealogical research questions fit one of three categories: Relationship For example, Who were the parents of A. B. Buss who lived in Jackson County, Michigan, in 1840? Identity For example, Which Benjamin Jones paying taxes in King George County, Virginia, in the 1820s and 1830s was Watts Jones’s son? Activity For example, What service (if any) did Josiah Burton, whose children were born in Norwich, Vermont, in the 1760s, provide during the Revolutionary War? — location: [330](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=330)

---
To obtain answers to our research questions, we consult sources. Most genealogical sources are published or unpublished written material or images of such textual material. Sometimes they are artifacts, like gravestones, needlework, photographs, and scrapbooks. Genealogical sources rarely are people; instead we use records of what people have experienced, observed, and said. — location: [344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=344)

---
Records are perhaps the most helpful genealogical sources because they were created to describe, document, memorialize, or note actions, events, observations, and utterances in which genealogists are interested. — location: [347](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=347)

---
Source refers to an entire item, not the information or evidence within it. In other words, sources are containers, not contents. — location: [352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=352)

---
Finding aids, indexes, and search engines usually are not genealogical sources. — location: [359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=359)

---
Authored work, original record, and derivative record are permanent attributes of sources. — location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=381)

---
Primary information is that reported by an eyewitness. — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=417)

---
Secondary information is reported by someone who obtained it from someone else. — location: [421](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=421)

---
Primary, secondary, and indeterminable are permanent attributes of information. — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=437)

Importance of information distinctions — location: [440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=440)

---
It alerts us to information items that — location: [443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=443)

---
may be more error prone than others. — location: [443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=443)

---
It causes us to pursue primary information. — location: [446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=446)

---
It strengthens our conclusions’ credibility. — location: [448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=448)

---
Evidence items are genealogical proof’s building blocks. — location: [476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=476)

---
Evidence items suggest answers to research questions. — location: [479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=479)

---
Direct evidence is an information item that answers a research question all by itself. When we consider the possibility that an information item describes what actually occurred we are using that information item as direct evidence. — location: [491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=491)

---
Indirect evidence is a set of two or more information items that suggest an answer to a research question only when they are combined. — location: [497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=497)

---
Negative evidence is the absence of information that answers a research question. — location: [505](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=505)

---
While direct evidence usually is what a source says, calculation based on information from one source does not make the evidence indirect. — location: [517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=517)

---
Indirect and negative evidence items, in contrast, are buried. They must be detected, and this detection requires higher-order thinking skills, like deductive and inductive reasoning. — location: [526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=526)

---
We use the authored/original/derivative-source and primary/secondary/indeterminable-information distinctions to assess vulnerabilities to error and guide us to the most likely accurate sources and information. — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=540)

---
Sources and information are tangibles, but evidence is not. — location: [544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=544)

---
Source and information categories are stable, but evidence categories are not. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=548)

---
An appropriate research scope enhances our ability to recognize erroneous information, test hypotheses, and assemble enough evidence to support and prove a valid conclusion. — location: [600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=600)

---
At least two independently-created evidence items in agreement. — location: [614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=614)

Some primary information. — location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=631)

---
Some original records. — location: [634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=634)

Relevant authored works, derivative records, and secondary information replaced by findable corresponding originals and primary information. — location: [638](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=638)

---
All findable sources that relevant sources and indexes suggest. — location: [644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=644)

---
If the facsimile bears no sign of alteration we assess it as we would assess the underlying physical source, which could be either an authored work or an original or derivative record. Only if an image bears evidence of alteration—cropping or blurring, for example—would we assess the image as a derivative and need to pursue the original. — location: [1221](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H48MNXS&location=1221)
