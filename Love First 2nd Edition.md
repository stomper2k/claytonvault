Outwardly, they may act as if they don't need anyone, but this is a deception. Alcoholics push others away to protect the addiction and to hide their shame—not because they've stopped caring. In fact, it is by giving alcoholics what they really want—love, appreciation, and respect—that we can persuade them that accepting treatment is the right thing to do. — location: [213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=213)

Love restores lost hope. — location: [220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=220)

For the first time, all involved— including the addict—see the problem not as a failure but as an illness that can respond to professional care. — location: [221](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=221)

Alcohol and drugs have taken loved ones away, — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=229)

and family members want them back. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=229)

The goal is to preserve dignity—both the addict's and the family's. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=231)

addicts can still be approached with love and respect, even when setting boundaries and presenting bottom lines. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=231)

Love is more powerful than brute force. — location: [233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=233)

---
When we intervene on the disease of addiction, we use love as a means to an end, because it is the means—not the end— that defines who we are and where this journey will take our family. — location: [237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=237)

Intervention is a way of raising the bottom. — location: [260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=260)

Renowned individuals step forward to educate us about breast cancer, AIDS, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. But stop and listen for a word or two of sensible advice on how families can help an alcoholic, and we'll hear very little. — location: [284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=284)

they are progressively unable to keep track of their own behavior and begin to lose contact with their emotions.… Alcoholics don't know what is happening inside of them." — location: [308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=308)

But first, we need to learn a language the alcoholic will understand. — location: [311](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=311)

---
Alcoholics and addicts use the blame game to deflect unwanted attention. — location: [315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=315)

It's a very effective technique. — location: [315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=315)

Promise them anything is one of his defenses. — location: [317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=317)

When an addict switches one drug for another, it's called switched addiction. — location: [327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=327)

---
For the same reasons discussed above, people who are chemically dependent can be very successful at abstaining for varying lengths of time. Let us tell you the story of a man who came to us for help. — location: [347](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=347)

---
Be aware of why alcoholics make promises. The nature of addiction forces alcoholics and addicts to engineer escape routes whenever they feel threatened. Many of their promises are escapes. Remember, the alcoholic is protecting access to "his solution"—alcohol or other mood-altering drugs—while keeping us, "his problem," at bay. — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=365)

---
These studies consistently come to the same conclusion: Alcoholism is an inherited disease, not a learned behavior. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=380)

---
The out-comes show that vulnerability for abusing marijuana, sedatives, heroin and other opiates, and hallucinogens is highly heritable. — location: [406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=406)

---
A child of an alcoholic parent has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the genetic components of the disease. The only reliable way to prevent alcoholism is to choose not to drink. — location: [433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=433)

---
The man who drinks for pleasure, it holds, may look for benefit in the counsels of others or in his own strength of will; but he who drinks because he cannot help it, being led by an irresistible impulse, is a sick man, and needs not a temperance pledge but a physician." — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=437)

---
A healthy brain is smooth and full, but the addicted brain is so severely atrophied that it resembles Swiss cheese. — location: [449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=449)

---
Drug addiction can degrade a brain's ability to make good decisions. A healthy prefrontal cortex considers risks versus benefits when making decisions. People with addicted brains, however, make choices without considering harm or punishment. Benefits are valued too highly while risks are undervalued. Consequently, decisions are based on immediate gratification and without regard for future consequences. When decision-making functions are corrupted in this way, addicts fail to learn from past mistakes and don't shift strategies when things are going wrong. Families often see this as willful bad behavior or lack of maturity, when it is actually a symptom of a damaged brain. — location: [464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=464)

---
Some researchers speculate that for those who use cocaine or meth in large amounts over prolonged periods, the damage could be irreversible. These serious and lasting consequences speak to the importance of intervening early. — location: [471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=471)

---
Brain areas most affected are those responsible for processing information during our daily lives: differentiating between good and bad, better and best; determining consequences of our decisions and predicting outcomes of our actions; moderating social behaviors; and working toward defined goals. — location: [475](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=475)

Alcohol and other drugs are more damaging to young brains than to adult brains. — location: [479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=479)

---
repeated exposure to alcohol during adolescence leads to long-lasting deficits in cognitive abilities, including learning and memory. — location: [480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=480)

---
tests of attention — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=482)

---
These deficits affect abilities necessary for successfully navigating the challenges of adolescence and for transitioning into adulthood. — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=482)

---
Because the adolescent brain continues to develop until age twenty-five, alcohol and other drug abuse during this time in a young persons life can alter the course of brain development, causing impairment in learning, attention, and memory. — location: [484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=484)

---
By doing so, the young brain can become permanently damaged, affecting both behavior and brain function into adulthood. — location: [486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=486)

---
it can also make the brain less able to learn important life skills that can help one avoid trouble as an adult." — location: [490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=490)

---
By intervening on the disease and getting our addict into treatment, we can halt the drug's damaging effects and begin the healing process. — location: [492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0038R8U0O&location=492)
