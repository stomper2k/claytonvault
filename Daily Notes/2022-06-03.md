- Get it out of your head. Free-form word vomit if necessary
- Add flesh to the skeleton through multiple passes with layers of editing.
	- Social context
	- Emotions
	- Balance negativity
	- kill clich√©s
	- describe nouns with adjectives
- Identify any "assumption gaps" and fill them
	- Be sure to answer the 5 questions answered by good writing
		- who
		- what
		- when
		- where
		- why
- Fix grammar; [Gramarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) can help
- Let the writing sit, and come back with fresh eyes
