Original source – the actual document or image of it such as a census, certificate, or ship’s passenger list. Derivative source – indexed or abstracted information created from an original record: an indexed marriage collection on FamilySearch, a book listing all the gravesites in a cemetery, an abstract of a will on an online family tree. Authored narrative – an online family tree, a family history, a biographical sketch, a research report, basically anything that involves someone compiling facts and information into a new form. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B3RYLPF&location=516)

Primary information: Given by a person who witnessed the event firsthand. A mother reporting the birth of her child in a family bible would be considered primary information. Secondary information: Given by a person who first obtained the information somewhere else, then reported it. That same child recording his birth on his draft registration would be secondary information. Although he was present at his birth, his mother told him his birthday. Undetermined information: Sometimes it’s unclear who the informant is, such as in a census record. You can make a guess, but it’s impossible to know who gave the names, ages, and birthplaces contained in a census record (except for 1940 where an  marks the informant). — location: [566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B3RYLPF&location=566)

Direct evidence: The information clearly states the answer to a research question, such as the date on a marriage certificate, answering when a couple married. Indirect evidence: The answer to the research question must be deduced by combining two or more facts. A woman listed as the mother-in-law of the head of household in a census record could be deduced to be his wife’s mother. Negative evidence occurs when the ancestor is not found in the expected time and place. If he had paid taxes on a piece of property for ten years and suddenly disappeared, that would signify either his death or his move to another location. — location: [582](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B3RYLPF&location=582)
