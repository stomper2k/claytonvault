Microsoft Teams

Some browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, don’t support Teams calls and meetings.

While it’s best to download the Teams app or use a different browser, you can join a call or meeting on one of these browsers and use your phone for audio. You’ll just have some limitations. Here’s what you can expect.

**Notes:** 

-   If your meeting doesn’t have a dial-in number, you won’t be able to join it on the web. You need audio to participate in a meeting or call.
    
-   For more on supported browsers, check out [Limits and specifications for Teams](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085123).
    

## What’ll work

Tons of great Teams calling and meeting features will still be available to you in unsupported browsers, including:

-   PowerPoint sharing
    
-   Whiteboard sketching
    
-   Meeting notes
    
-   Participant list
    
-   Meeting info
    
-   Recording
    
-   Live captions
    

## What won't

Unfortunately, some important features won’t be available, including:

-   Video
    
-   Audio
    
-   Desktop, window, and app sharing
    

## Use your phone for meeting audio

If you join a meeting on a browser that doesn’t support calling or meetings and there’s a phone number in the meeting invite, then you’ll need to use a phone for audio. You can either have Teams call you or dial in manually.

**Have Teams call you**

Follow the prompts to have Teams call you.

**Dial in manually**

There are a couple of ways you can dial in manually:

-   Use the phone number in the meeting invitation
    
-   Join the meeting online, then select **More options** ![More options button](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5.png) > **Show call info** and use the dial-in information or have Teams call you there
