# John [[Clendening]] found dead
FOUND DEAD. Last Tuesday afternoon the news spread up town, that an old man who had been camping and fishing in the river bottom below Woodard & Norton's mill, was found drowned in the river about a quarter of a mile below the cut-off. He had apparently been in the water for about ten days and, consequently, his body was very much decomposed. Judging from all the surroundings and the manner in which his body was found attached to the trotline, it appears reasonable to suppose that, while in his boat working with his lines, he fell from some cause over board, and being perhaps entangled in the lines, was drowned. He was towed to shore, as soon as found, and the coroner notified, who viewed the body about six o'clock in the evening and rendered a verdict in accordance with the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. Some of the neighbors had learned from the old man, that he had friends living on Duck Creek. Messengers were sent up and it was found that he had a daughter, Mrs. [[Shipley]]. Mr. [[Shipley]], J. H. [[Old]] and R. C. [[Tilden]] cam \[sic\] down Wednesday morning and took charge of the reamins \[sic\] which were burried \[sic\] at Sirea \[sic\] cemetery on Duck Creek. From the gentlemen named we learned that the deceased's name was John [[Clendening]], aged about 64 years. He leaves three sons and two daughters, all grown. Two sons and one daughter live in Commanche county, Kansas, on son at Rich Hill, Mo., and the other daughter, Mrs. [[Shipley]], on Duck Creek. He had been fishing for about two months, more for pass-time than profit, and last visited his home about four weeks ago.
