With a free add-on for Microsoft Word, you can turn your Zotero citations into proper CMOS footnotes, endnotes, or bibliographical records in articles you write. — location: [188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MG34188&location=188)Add-ons are also available for Libre Office.

While you could create a single entry for a newspaper, for example, then put the date and title of the articles in your notes, it can be useful to make each newspaper article its own entry. The newsletter articles, being dated, can create a timeline of events. — location: [1343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MG34188&location=1343)

rather than cite the name of the newspaper only once in Zotero, I chose to make each article its own entry in Zotero. By creating them in Zotero separately, I am creating a timeline of my ancestor’s activities over nearly five decades. — location: [1351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MG34188&location=1351)

As we create citations, the most important questions we need to ask are these: —Can this citation lead people back to this source, if it is accessible?   —Does this citation demonstrate that a reliable source has been used as evidence? — location: [1394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MG34188&location=1394)

---
Always begin by looking for a Zotero item type that is already a match to EE. — location: [1471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MG34188&location=1471)

---
because some of Zotero’s fields are for storage only and are not included in the formatting of a bibliographic entry. Be sure you choose what you need based on the citation output, rather than the data input. — location: [1485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MG34188&location=1485)

---
When I put a new entry in Zotero based on information in EE, I put “EE” and the page number in the Extra field in Zotero. — location: [1511](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MG34188&location=1511)

If you are documenting a non-government institution as the creator of the material, you will begin with the name of the institution, putting the location in parentheses. All of this will be placed in the Last Name field. Example: Immaculate Conception Church (Natchitoches, Louisiana). — location: [1563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MG34188&location=1563)
